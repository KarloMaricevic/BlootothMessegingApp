Discoverability:
1. For now application doesn't know if it was in discoverable bluetooth state when user enters one of the screens
2. If the user has manually disabled discoverability "Make discoverable" button state should be updated

Solution: Implement monitoring(periodic) of bluetooth discoverability state (doesn't require permission), move enabled logic to VM
